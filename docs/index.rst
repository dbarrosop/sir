SDN Internet Router (sir)
=========================

The SDN Internet Router (sir) adds some extra capabilities to your conventional router or L3 switch. It can, for
example, instruct your router which prefixes to install, allowing you to use a switch/router with a limited LPM
table to get the full BGP feed from your Service Provider or to peer with other people.
