SDN Internet Router (sir)
=========================

This tool in combination with [pmacct](http://www.pmacct.net/) allows you to get the full BGP feed from your upstream providers/peers and install on the FIB only the relevant prefixes for you. The main benefit of this approach is that you will not need a very expensive router to do peering. A cheap and very fast switch might be enough.

I recommend you to start reading the [First Steps](http://sdn-internet-router-sir.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users_guide/first_steps.html), there you can see what this is about, what you need and how to achieve it.

You can also check the following [slides](docs/_static/SDN_Internet_Router-sir-Nov14.pdf) and [video](http://youtu.be/o1njanXhQqM?list=PLXSSXAe33jI2IIWtfnnEj5J7B7KoixKCe).

Note
====

This software is in very early stages. There is a lot of documentation missing and some bits and pieces might be refactored. If you plan to test it I suggest you contact me. I can help you to deploy it while keeping you informed of the changes I might be doing that could potentially affect you.
